You can contribute in many ways:

Types of Contributions
----------------------

Report Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~

Report bugs at https://github.com/riscv/riscof/issues.

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/riscv/riscof/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `riscof` for local development.

1. Fork the `riscof` repo on GitLab.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone  https://github.com/riscv/riscof.git

3. Create an issue and WIP merge request that creates a working branch for you::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

4. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitLab::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

5. Submit a merge request through the GitLab website.

Versioning
----------

When issuing pull requests, an entry in the CHANGELOG.md is mandatory. The arch-test-repo adheres to
the [`Semantic Versioning`](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) scheme. Following guidelines must
be followed while assigning a new version number :

- Patch-updates: all doc updates (like typos, more clarification,etc) and updates to unratified extensions.
- Minor-updates: Fixing bugs in current features, adding new features which do not break current features or working.
- Major-updates: Changes to the framework flow (backward compatible or incompatible).

Note: You can have either a patch or minor or major update.
Note: In case of a conflict, the maintainers will decide the final version to be assigned.

To update the version of the Python package for deployment you can use the following::

$ bumpversion --no-tag --config-file setup.cfg patch # possible: major / minor / patch


Merge Request Guidelines
----------------------------

Before you submit a merge request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The merge request should include tests (if any).
2. If the merge request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. 
3. The merge request should work for Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8, and for PyPi. 
   and make sure that the tests (if any) pass for all supported Python versions.

Deploying
---------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed.
Then run::

$ bumpversion --no-tag --config-file setup.cfg patch # possible: major / minor / patch
$ git push origin name-of-your-branch
